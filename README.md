## üì± Quick Start

### Using the App:

**Normal Mode** (Simple Metronome):
1. Set **Start BPM** to your desired tempo
2. Adjust **Beats/Bar** if needed (default is 4)
3. Tap beats to set accents or mute them
4. Press **START**
5. Adjust tempo or beats while playing!

**Simple Ramp Mode** (Tempo Change):
1. Set **Start BPM** (e.g., 60)
2. Set **End BPM** to different value (e.g., 120)
3. Set **BPM Increment** (e.g., 5) - how much tempo increases each time
4. Set **Bars/Tempo** (e.g., 4) - how many bars at each tempo
5. Press **START** - you'll get a countdown, then the tempo will gradually increase

**Complex Ramp Mode** (Multi-Segment Practice):
1. Configure first segment parameters
2. Press **Save Segment**
3. Configure next segment parameters
4. Press **Save Segment** again
5. Repeat as needed
6. Press **START** to play all segments in sequence

### Beat Control:

**Tap any beat dot to cycle through states:**
- **Normal** - Light grey, plays regular sound
- **Accent** - Gold outline, plays higher-pitched sound
- **Muted** - Very dark, completely silent

Perfect for:
- Creating complex rhythmic patterns
- Practicing with partial metronome support
- Building rhythmic independence
- Custom accent patterns (not just beat 1)

## üéõÔ∏è Controls

### Knobs (Top Section):

**First Row:**
- **Start BPM** (40-400) - Initial tempo or only tempo in normal mode
- **End BPM** (40-400) - Final tempo for ramp modes

**Second Row:**
- **BPM Increment** (0-50) - How much tempo changes each step
- **Bars/Tempo** (1-100) - Number of bars to play at each tempo
- **Beats/Bar** (1-12) - Time signature (4 = 4/4, 3 = 3/4, etc.)

**Tips:**
- Drag knobs up/down to adjust
- Tap the number below each knob for direct entry (numpad)
- Start and End BPM sync automatically in normal mode

### Buttons:

- **START/STOP** - Begin or stop the metronome
- **Save Segment** - Add current settings as a segment
- **Remove Last** - Delete the most recent segment
- **Clear All** - Remove all saved segments

## üîä Sound Styles

The metronome includes 4 different sound options:

1. **Classic** (default) - Smooth sine wave tones
2. **Woodblock** - Percussive wood block simulation
3. **Click** - Sharp, precise click sound
4. **Beep** - Electronic triangle wave beep

### How to Change Sound:

Edit `script.js` and add this line near the beginning (around line 22):

```javascript
this.soundStyle = 'woodblock'; // or 'click', 'beep', 'classic'
```

**For example:**
```javascript
constructor() {
    // Audio context
    this.audioContext = null;
    this.soundStyle = 'woodblock'; // Add this line
    
    // State
    this.isRunning = false;
    ...
```

Save the file and refresh your browser!
